#Crpytocurrency Starter Kit

##Introduction
Welcome to the cryptocurrency Starter Kit.  This page and any related content in the repo have been created to help those who want to get involved with, hold, mine, or trade this exciting new movement.


##What are cryptocurrencies?

A cryptocurrency (or crypto currency) is a digital asset designed to work as a medium of exchange that uses cryptography to secure its transactions, to control the creation of additional units, and to verify the transfer of assets.[1][2][3] Cryptocurrencies are classified as a subset of digital currencies and are also classified as a subset of alternative currencies and virtual currencies. [Extract from Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency)

##How does it work?

If you are interested in knowing how the underlying technology works then you might want to start by reading the [bitcoin whitepaper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf) by Satoshi Nakamoto. There are many different currencies out there now but you might also want to read about Ethereum and Litecoin.

If white papers are not your thing and you are only interested in trading then [Coindesk's much lighter article on cryptocurrencies and blockchain](www.imdb.com/title/tt6467152/) may be a better place for you, and then move on to creating a wallet or an account on an exchange (see below).
